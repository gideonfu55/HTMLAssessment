# Assessment
FSD Assessment

●	What did you like about this project?
The project was very challenging for me, but I learnt a lot during the process of it and I enjoyed seeing how the page worked out after much tinkering. I think applying the media query and RWD was the best part of it, as you start to think more in the bigger picture perhaps and plan about how the html should be written in the individual sections from the start.

●	What did you struggle with in this project?
The CSS alignments was still a big struggle for me, and it was hard to get everything in place. Doing up the html while trying to be mindful of how the CSS portion works was also a huge challenge. At the Courses section, I was also caught up with how to place the course boxes and align them - time management became a problem for me.

●	What would make your experience with this assessment better?
I feel that there could be more of a incremental process for us, like to be able to practice on each parts first before doing a large scale project would really help for beginners like myself. :D
